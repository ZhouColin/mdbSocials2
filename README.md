## Description
Hi! This is my second project that I've made for Mobile Developers of Berkeley. This project is a Pokedex, where users can search from all of the Pokemon! It consists of 3 screens, you can see the total number of Pokemon, click on each to view their description, and also filter from the Pokemon list. I had lots of fun making this project, but in the future I would definitely try to condense some of the code I wrote for the advanced filtering. Furthermore, I managed to follow the model of MVC this time, so I definitely would like to see improvement in the future!
